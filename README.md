# picapica-bot

a trial of writing a simple discord bot: Pica pica is the scientific name of the Eurasian magpie (歐亞喜鵲).

## How to use

### Setting up a token

Place a bot token obtained from https://discord.com/developers/ in a new file called `config.json`.
<!-- `.env`. File contents should appear as: -->

```json
{
	"token": "your-token-goes-here"
}
```

Read these guides on [how to obtain a token](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html) and [how to configure a dotenv file](https://discordjs.guide/creating-your-bot/#using-environment-variables) to learn more.

### `npm`, `pnpm` setup

In the git directory run `npm install` to install the necessary prerequisites. If this does not work, you need to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/). Or, you may use `pnpm install` if you have [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed.
